# A JavaScript full text search engine

This is an implementation of a "vector space model" with "Porter stemming", "double-metaphones", false boolean searches, field searching and field weighting. Basically it a full text search engine that has most of the fancy features the well known search engines libraries like Sphinx, Solr, Lucene, etc. The big difference is that it is written in JavaScript originally for use with Node.js but I'm sure it will work with other common.js platforms!


## Example

	var Search = require('./../lib/Search').Search;
	var nStore = require('./lib/nstore');

	// A simple data set to search over, feel free to use any data source, nstore uses JavaScript objects so it's simple
	var db = nStore('data/example.db');

	db.all(null,function (err, docs, metas) {
	  if (err) throw err;
		var s = new Search();
		s.fieldWeights.title = 5;
		s.index(docs); // Create a search index, this should only be done when app loads or data changes
		var terms = "meet !poultry";
		var results = s.query(terms,["title"]); // search only the title field 
		for(var i=0;i<results.length;i++){
			console.log(results[i].id+" "+docs[results[i].id].title +" "+  results[i].rank);
		}
	});

## Things that it doesn't currently do but would like to look into:	

Phrase based searches, everything is word based, combonations of words are not currently supported
Exact matches, all words are converted to stemmed metaphones so "ponies" is indexed as the sound of "pony".
Date based searches or other meta data with additional logic are not currently supported
tf-idf based ranking, currently using a term count
